# Guidelines for GitHub 

**1. Use Meaningful and Consistent Naming Conventions**
* Use clear and descriptive names for files and directories.
* Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase, snake_case) throughout the project.

**2. Separate Work into Branches**
* Each team member should work on their own branch.
* Name branches based on the feature or task being worked on (e.g., feature/login-page, bugfix/user-auth).

**3. Regularly Merge Changes from the Main Branch**
* Team members should regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep their branch updated and minimize conflicts.

**4. Use .gitignore**
* Use a .gitignore file to exclude files and directories that should not be tracked by Git (e.g., node_modules/, .env, *.log).

**5. Code Reviews and Pull Requests**
* Use pull requests for merging changes into the main branch.
* Ensure code reviews are conducted before merging to maintain code quality and consistency.

**6. Branching Strategy**
* **main:** Stable, production-ready code.
* **develop:** Latest development changes.
* **feature/feature-name:** New features.
* **bugfix/bug-name:** Bug fixes.

**7 Commit Messages**
* Use clear, concise commit messages following a consistent format.
* Example format: type(scope): message (e.g., feat(auth): add login functionality).
